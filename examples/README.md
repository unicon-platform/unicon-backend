# Examples

## [Classic Problem Set](problem_set/)

A collection of tasks from [CS2109S](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2109S/introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning) Problem Sets and Lecture Trainings to demonstrate the use of the intermediate representation to model different task types from non-programming tasks to programming tasks.

## [Breakthrough](breakthrough/)

A implementation of a single match of [Breakthrough](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)>) between two players via the our custom contest/task intermediate representation. It makes use of the control flow and branching constructs like `Loop` and `IfElse` to implement turn-based game logic.

## [Addition](addition/)

A trivial example (adding two numbers) to simplify testing the system for very specific cases. (error handling, malicious input)
